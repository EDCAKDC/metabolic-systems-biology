Learning Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and metabolic modeling with COBRApy.   
Day 1: first FBA script + flux visualization.  
Day 2: Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) + knockout simulation.  
Day 3: reaction/gene essentiality scan + essentiality classification + basic visualization.  
Day 4: FVA-based metabolic rewiring analysis after PFK knockout (Δ flux-range detection + top-perturbed reactions).  
Day 5: robustness analysis (single-KO curve) + double knockout synthetic lethality mapping.  
Day 6: gene knockout analysis (GPR-based single-gene KO) + gene essentiality classification + robustness curves + optional pathway-level gene KO.  
Day 7: Constructed a gene–reaction bipartite metabolic network, annotated nodes with essentiality from single-gene/reaction KO, computed topological centrality metrics, identified articulation-point vulnerabilities, and generated multiple network visualizations.  
Day 8: Modeled glucose-dependent growth by varying exchange-reaction bounds, showing classic linear limitation behavior in FBA.  
Day 9: Explored the feasible flux space via randomized sampling and visualized flux variability and PCA structure.  
Day 10: Nutrient-scan trade-off analysis  
Day 11: Implemented multi-objective FBA by constraining biomass to a fixed fraction of its maximum value and optimizing product secretion, generating a full biomass–product Pareto frontier for metabolic trade-off analysis.  
Day 12 – Reaction-level metabolic rewiring: WT vs Pareto model  
Day 13: Computed reaction-level metabolic activity by mapping gene expression onto GPR rules, converting pseudo-bulk (or mock) gene expression into reaction expression values to enable expression-constrained metabolic modeling.  
Day 14: Applied gene-expression–based flux bound scaling (E-Flux) and compared WT vs expression-constrained fluxes to reveal expression-driven metabolic rewiring.  
Day 15: Performed subsystem-level flux rewiring analysis (WT vs E-Flux); results appear flat because Day 13 used random mock expression, so the plots are not biologically meaningful.

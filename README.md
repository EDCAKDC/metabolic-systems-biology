Learning Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and metabolic modeling with COBRApy.   
Day 1: first FBA script + flux visualization.  
Day 2: Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) + knockout simulation.  
Day 3: reaction/gene essentiality scan + essentiality classification + basic visualization.  
Day 4: FVA-based metabolic rewiring analysis after PFK knockout (Δ flux-range detection + top-perturbed reactions).  
Day 5: robustness analysis (single-KO curve) + double knockout synthetic lethality mapping.

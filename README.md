Learning Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and metabolic modeling with COBRApy.   
Day 1: first FBA script + flux visualization.  
Day 2: Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) + knockout simulation.  
Day 3: reaction/gene essentiality scan + essentiality classification + basic visualization.  
Day 4: FVA-based metabolic rewiring analysis after PFK knockout (Δ flux-range detection + top-perturbed reactions).  
Day 5: robustness analysis (single-KO curve) + double knockout synthetic lethality mapping.  
Day 6: gene knockout analysis (GPR-based single-gene KO) + gene essentiality classification + robustness curves + optional pathway-level gene KO.  
Day 7: Constructed a gene–reaction bipartite metabolic network, annotated nodes with essentiality from single-gene/reaction KO, computed topological centrality metrics, identified articulation-point vulnerabilities, and generated multiple network visualizations.  
Day 8: Modeled glucose-dependent growth by varying exchange-reaction bounds, showing classic linear limitation behavior in FBA.  
Day 9: Explored the feasible flux space via randomized sampling and visualized flux variability and PCA structure.  
Day 10: Nutrient-scan trade-off analysis
